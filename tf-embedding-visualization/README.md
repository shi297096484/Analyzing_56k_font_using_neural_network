### Visualize embedding space in 3D with T-SNE

#### Before you run the code, make sure that:

* Check the requirement.txt file
* It is highly recommended that you use anaconda in installing TensorFlow

```
$ cd ~/(Your local path)/Analyzing_56k_font_using_neural_network/tf-embedding-visualization
$ python test.py
$ tensorboard --logdir logdir
```
Then there will be a TensorBoard host on your local machine and you can check it by yourself!
